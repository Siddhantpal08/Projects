# Projects
stages of project can be 
1. Profession based / if user is smart then  requirement based.
2. laptop details according to profession or requirement
3. layout designing of website
4. Coding the entire thing.
5. Storing the user input somewhere ( will figure out ).
6. Make it presentable.
7. Give actual presentation of whole website as a group.

We can delegate the tasks into smaller parts and can combine them... Either you can choose the tasks you want to do or you can get assigned...
we need this whole project done before 1st November and present it.
in between we have Navratri,dusshera,Diwali and few more busy days...
so this should be done ASAP in these days whenever time available.... so that we don't affect out festivals...
Hoping this teamwork will work in our favour and will lead us into something better...
